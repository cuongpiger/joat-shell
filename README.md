# Joat Shell
## _aka_ Jack-of-all-trades for Shell

# 1. Introduction
- This is a collection of shell scripts that I use to make my life easier.
- Currently, I focus on **async** and **parallel** processing in shell scripts.
- I also have a few scripts for INI file parsing, logging, and other stuff.
